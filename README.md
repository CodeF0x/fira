# Fira

This project aims to try out Tailwind 4, authorization via Bearer Tokens and session handling from scratch, test my Rust + SQLite API and to see if AI Coding agents are any good.
I'll rely heavily on AI to style the app with Tailwind and to write / generate unit tests. The actual TypeScript part is too much fun to let AI do it :D.
When the project is finished, I'll review the work the AI has done and evaluate the quality of its work and if it actually made me more productive.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.14.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
